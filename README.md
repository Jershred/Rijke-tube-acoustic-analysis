## Project
### Introduction
The objective of this practical session was to investigate the acoustic properties of a flame organ experiment. Specifically, the goal was to determine the expected frequencies and to visualize the standing pressure eigenmodes within the tube.

To achieve this, the model was simplified by treating the flame as a boundary between a cold airflow and a hot flow. This simplified model was used to construct a stability map of the Rijke tube to identify the most unstable frequencies and the associated tones. By visualizing the structure of the standing pressure eigenmodes, we were able to use the Rayleigh criterion to describe their unstable nature.
